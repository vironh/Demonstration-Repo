/* The are three ways to call items in css.
1. Target by item name. Here you simply use the tem name 
from your html file. This will target ALL items with
that name. Example: */
h3 {
    /* This will change the styles
    of all h3 elements */
}

/* 2. Target by class. You can assign a class to any
item in html by typing class = "Insert any chosen name"
You can assign the same class to numerous items.
Then target that item as follows: */
.circle-images {

}

/* 3. Target by id. Similar to class, you can assign
an id to any item in html by typing: id= " insert any name"
An id applies to only ONE item in html.
Then target it as follows: */
#specific-id-item {

}

/* For all of the above you can make adjustments in terms
of style to the item between the {} brackets. 
This can include color, size, height, width, text,
background color, rounded sides etc. */
