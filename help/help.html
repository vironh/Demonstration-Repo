<!-- html is the basic language of web development
It includes all of the items and info that will be 
visible to a web user. It does not have design
elements, but it does assign hierarchy in terms of
which headings are more important or bigger etc. 
It also provides the basic layout which will later
be edited in css to look more appealing.
 -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <!-- Every html file provides this basic layout
    when typing in html5 to start with. -->
 <html lang="en"> 
    <!-- "en" refers to the language being used
    and can technically be changed to a different
    language. American English is used.-->
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- You can change the >Document< name here
    to the name of your project -->
 </head>

<!-- After the head you can insert a header.
This can be anything that remains at the top of 
your website, but is typically the navigation bar.
See below. In the nav add an unordered list or ul. 
Here you will insert a tab links to the rest of 
your website's pages. -->

 <header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <a href="home.html"> <li>Home</li></a>
            <a href="about.html"><li>About</li></a>
            <a href="contact.html"><li>Contact</li></a>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

 <body>
    <!--In the body you would insert paragraphs,
    headings, images and other items that will appear
    on the website below the header  -->

    <div></div>
    <section></section>
    <article></article>
    <!-- The above are containers/folders
    and you can basically separate the different
    parts of your web pade with these items --> 

    <h1></h1>
    <!-- This would be your biggest heading.
    It can go down to smaller headings like h6 etc. -->

    <i></i>
    <em></em>
    <!-- The italic and emphasis items can be applied
    to text to make it italics -->

    <strong></strong>
    <b></b>
    <!-- The strong and bold options make your text
    appear bold -->

    <!-- You get inline elements that appear in a
    single line or continuously across various lines.
    Then you get block elements that are automatically
    separated and placed on the next line.
    You can apply an <inline> or <block> or 
    <inline-block to any set of items.-->

    <br>
    <!-- Unlike other items that have an opening
    and closing, breaks are single items that can
    placed anywhere where you want to insert a break. -->

    <a href="paste or type link">Insert a name of your choosing here</a>
    <!-- The above is a link and is inserted by typing
    a and tab. You can insert either an internal link
    or an external link.
    Internal links refer to your own local links or
    any tabs you may have created. For these you need 
    to include the name of your file between the ""
    External links take you to separate websites. 
    For these you need to insert the actual web
    address between the "" .
    If you want the link to open in a new tab and not
    in the exsisting one, you need to insert:
    "target"_blank
    just after the "" where you inserted the link.-->

    <img src="Insert a link or type local address.jpg" alt="Type a description of what the image shows for blind people">
    <!-- If you are using a local image make sure
    it is renamed to something easy for you to type -->
    <!-- You can also resize images in html, though it
    is not advised. For resizing type after "alt"
    height: "pixel size px" or "number %" -->

    <a href="insert link"><img src="Insert image address" alt="Type description of image"></a>
    <!-- The above shows how you can make an imane a 
    clickable link. When you hover over the image on 
    the website, it will show the link that it will
    redirect you to when you click on it. -->
